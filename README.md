# CASS-Iot-Project
This project was developed as part of the IEEE CASS Challenge. It integrates embedded systems, computer vision, and server-side processing to build a smart monitoring solution. The system uses an ESP32 and ESP32-CAM to capture and transmit data to a Python-based server for processing and analysis.
